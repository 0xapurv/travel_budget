## How To Use This Resource

Each episode where code is created or modified will have an associated branch
in this repo. The code in each episodes branch will contain the the completed code from the episode
and the branch will remain in that state.

The master branch will contain the most recent version of code, and be considered the "production" version.
This means all the master branch will always be the most up to date.


Any questions should be asked in the comments of the relevant video on YouTube.
